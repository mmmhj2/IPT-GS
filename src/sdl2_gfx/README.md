This directory includes a truncated version of SDL2_gfx library.
The visualization node utilizes some of its functionality to draw graphics primitives.

This directory is included in the repository for the ease of compilation,
because SDL2_gfx does not have Cmake support, which makes compiling with catkin_make difficult.
